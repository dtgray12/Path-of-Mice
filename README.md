### Design
Path of Mice is a point-and-click adventure that uses buttons and text commands. Common commands include directional inputs like “north”, “south”, “east”, “west” for navigating between rooms, “search” or “scavenge” to search the current room for hidden items and “read (<em>object name</em>)” or “talk <em>object name</em>” to interact with objects and NPCs.

Path of Mice features four starter <b>“Paths”</b> or <em>storylines</em> to follow that help shape your adventure. Should you choose the path of <em>Discovery</em> you venture out into the far reaches of the forest on a grand adventure. Should you choose the path of <em>Bravery</em> you embark on a monster hunting crusade. Should you choose the path of <em>Fortune</em> you embark on an epic treasure hunt. Should you choose the path of <em>Insight</em> you set out on a quest to unlock withheld secrets.
