by Daryl Gray<br>

### Introduction
*Path of Mice* is an **IFRPG** (Interactive Fantasy Role-Playing Game) built using **HTML5**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. Designed like a **CYOA** (choose your own adventure), *Path of Mice* allows the player to forge their own path as a mouse in a world teeming with mystery and danger.

The game is played by reading an interactive story while choosing commands when prompted. These commands are displayed either through the dialogue or in the choice menu. ~~There is a list of available commands at the start of the game and this list can be accessed at any given time by typing help.~~

### Story
The story takes place in the forest of Briarwood as you, a mouse on a path anew, embark on a grand adventure. Your choices progresses the story as you explore the mysterious and dangerous forest of Briarwood.

As the lead in your story, every choice you make is added to your <i>**Journal**</i>. This book can be used to review various topics like **Stats**, **Abilities**, **Quests**, **Creatures** and more.

### Mechanics
In the game, the player clicks links within the **Dialogue** or **Adventure Menu** to progress the adventure. Common choices include *directional commands* like **Go North** or **Climb Ladder** depending on the room or area; while other choices will appear when available like **Explore** or  **Rest**.

Some in-game actions can create dialogue that can help or harm the player. For example, having the item **Torch** or **Lantern** in your inventory will automatically illuminate a dark room adding extra dialogue and visual clues.

##### Game Design
*Path of Mice* is designed for PC and Mobile using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. The game is designed like an animated book that page turns during the adventure. The idea is that the game is a live recording your adventures and is based off the book series <i>**Tristan's Travels**</i>. The series is about a happy traveling mouse from the forest of Briarwood and acts as a world building window.
